# Building platform-specific installers

If you wish your application to be invoked like a normal platform native
application, you must create separate installers for each platform you wish to
support. Here we provide instructions for creating installers for Windows, Mac
OS X and Linux.

Alternatively, you can run Getdown [[Applet Mode|as an applet]] and avoid creating
per-platform installers.

## Windows

TBD (NSIS installer)

## Mac OS X

TBD (standard Mac OS app)

## Linux

TBD (makeself installer)

## Example

You can see an example of how to build all of the above installers here:
